# Julia Notebooks

Some Julia Jupyter/Colab Notebooks to learn and play around with the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/).

Right now, there's just one notebook:

* [Julia_Colab_Notebook_Template.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/julia_notebooks/blob/master/Julia_Colab_Notebook_Template.ipynb)
  * This is a template to create Colab notebooks for Julia. It was inspired by the notebooks proposed in [this discussion](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-on-google-colab-free-gpu-accelerated-shareable-notebooks/15319/24), with additional features.
  * It supports setting the version of Julia easily (from 0.7.0 to the latest version).
  * Easy to change the list Julia packages to install.

_Enjoy!_
